title: "24 Days of GHC Extensions: Template Haskell"
---

Today I'm happy to announce another guest post; this time
[Sean Westfall](http://fieldsofgoldfish.posthaven.com/) is going to give us an
extensive run down on Template Haskell. Template Haskell is a somewhat
contentious extension, but still remains an important tool in the Haskellers
toolbox, allowing us to solve problems concisely. Sean's gone in to a great
amount of detail in this post, and you'll be sure to take something away with
you.

------

Template Haskell is an extension of Haskell 98 that allows for compile-time
metaprogramming -- allowing one to directly convert back and forth between
concrete Haskell syntax and the underlying abstract syntax tree (AST) of
GHC. Anyone familiar with Lisp's macro system will immediately recognize the
similarities -- though in Haskell, specific datatypes are used to represent an
AST that is used to draw and splice back in code fragments. The ability to
generate code at compile time allows one to implement macro-like expansions,
polytypic programs, user directed optimization (such as inlining), and the
generation of supporting data structures and functions from existing data
structures and functions.[^1]

In brief, Oxford brackets `[|` and `|]` are used to get the abstract syntax tree
for the enclosed expression and 'splice' brackets `$(` and `)` are used to
convert from the abstract syntax tree back into Haskell. The Quotation Monad is
used to give unique names to the parsed tokens from the supplied Haskell code,
and reification can be used to look up the name, type, constructor, and state of
expression, and as well as the AST of Haskell types.[^4]

Template Haskell was introduced by Tim Sheard and Simon Peyton Jones in their
paper "Template Meta-Programming for Haskell" (The original paper can be found
[here](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/meta-haskell/meta-haskell.pdf))
in 2002, though its changed quite a bit since (see
[here](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/tmp/notes2.ps)). It
was inspired by C++ templates, though TH is functionally more similar to a macro
system. [Quasiquotation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Quote.html)
is often used in conjunction with Template Haskell, but makes up a pretty big
section, so I will only briefly describe it here. Only another full article of
its own, could do quasiquotation justice.

In the wild, Template Haskell is used extensively by Yesod for routing and HTML
template binding.[^8] Outside of Haskell, compile-time metaprogramming is used
for the creation of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), typically in the domains
of testing and modeling, and generative metaprogramming (compile-time or not)
for object relational mapping, typically for mapping database schemas to
non-compiled code. And within Lisp, which is famous for it's macro system,
metaprogramming is used to create syntax extensions (syntactic sugar), such as
the syntax used in lisp comprehensions.[^3]

_All code in this guide was executed with GHCi version 7.6.3 and Template
Haskell version 2.9.0.0_


To get started, start up GHCi with the Template Haskell extension by including
`-XTemplateHaskell`, then load the AST datatypes:

```
$ ghci -XTemplateHaskell
Prelude> :m + Language.Haskell.TH
Prelude Language.Haskell.TH>
```

To see the AST syntax of some Haskell code insert valid Haskell syntax into
oxford brackets and run it through `runQ` which stands for the Q monad
(quotation monad):

```
> runQ [| 1 + 2 |]
InfixE (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1))) (VarE GHC.Num.+) (Just (LitE (IntegerL 2)))
```

If you parse through the parentheses you'll see the return expression forms a
tree -- an abstract syntax tree!

![abstract syntax tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanwestfall/templatehaskell/master/syntax_tree.png)

Checkout the lift class
[source](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.7.0.0/docs/src/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#Lift),
which is what's being invoked by the oxford brackets. The
Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax contains the definitions of all the types used in the
AST. Using these types, it's possible to construct any fragment of the Haskell
language. Have a look at the
[Lit](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#t:Lit)
data type as an example. Lit stands for literal,

```haskell
data Lit = CharL Char
         | StringL String
         | IntegerL Integer     -- ^ Used for overloaded and non-overloaded
                                -- literals. We don't have a good way to
                                -- represent non-overloaded literals at
                                -- the moment. Maybe that doesn't matter?
         | RationalL Rational   -- Ditto
         | IntPrimL Integer
         | WordPrimL Integer
         | FloatPrimL Rational
         | DoublePrimL Rational
         | StringPrimL String	-- ^ A primitive C-style string, type Addr#
    deriving( Show, Eq, Data, Typeable )
```

tokens represented by it make up literals defined throughout your syntax in the
AST, as you can see in our example AST above. Within Language.Haskell.TH.syntax,
35 generic data types are declared with the
[Data.Data](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Data.html)
module. If you're curious about what the AST syntax is referring to study the
[source](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.7.0.0/docs/src/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#line-716).

The
[Q](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#t:Q)
monad handles the expression's typing via context, and also gives it a unique
[name](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/src/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#newName)
by appending an integer at the end of the expression name to handle scoping
distinction. Quotations are lexically scoped and the Q monad handles this using
it's naming scheme. (see the user's guide
[wiki](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/template-haskell.html)
for a more in depth explanation of TH's lexical scoping).

Let's bind the returned AST expression from the example above to Haskell and
evaluate it, using the splice brackets:

```
> $( return (InfixE (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1))) (VarE (mkName "+")) (Just (LitE (IntegerL 2)))))
3
```

Ta da, you converted concrete Haskell to AST and then evaluated it. Though, as
you can see, identifiers have to be defined with the `mkName` type in the AST to
evaluate properly.

It's possible to avoid having to modify the AST to splice it back, but you'll
have to bind it to a variable, as my next example illustrates:

In this example, the Fibonacci sequence is generated using zipWith:[^2]

```haskell
let fibs :: [Integer]
    fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

let fibQ :: Int -> Q Exp
    fibQ n = [| fibs !! n |]
```

Now run `$( ... )` to excute the expansion:

```
> $(fibQ 22)
17711
```

TH splices in the expression that `fibQ` represents along with the variable
(that is `fibs !! n`).

Note, expressions and splices can be nested:

```
> $(runQ [| fibs !! $( [| 8 |]) |])
21
```

I'll explain TH's syntax next -- but after, I'll show some more impressive
examples that show the possibilities of splicing and ASTs.

#### Syntax

Template Haskell quotation expression come with 4 different parser types, and an
extensive 5th optional type that allows one to define their own types of
quotations, called quasi-quotations.

* `[| ... |]`, or `[e| ... |]`, generates expression AST syntax; it has the type `Q Exp`.

    ```
    > runQ [| 1 + 2 |]
    InfixE (Just (LitE (IntegerL 1))) (VarE GHC.Num.+) (Just (LitE (IntegerL 2)))
    ```

* `[d| ... |]`, generates a list of top-level declaration AST sytnax; it has the type `Q [Dec]`.

    ```
    > runQ [d|x = 5|]
    [ValD (VarP x_4) (NormalB (LitE (IntegerL 5))) []]
    ```

* `[t| ... |]`, generates a type AST syntax; it has the type `Q Type`.

    ```
    > runQ [t|Int|]
    ConT GHC.Types.Int
    ```

* `[p| ... |]`, generates a pattern AST syntax; it has the type `Q Pat`.

    ```
    > runQ [p|(x,y)|]
    TupP [VarP x_5,VarP y_6]
    ```

* Custom "quasi-quotations", have the form `["quoter"| ... |]`. The "quoter" can
  be anything except e, d, t, and p, and the token cannot contain
  spaces. Though, all GHC is doing is determining which parser to use based on
  the context within the oxford brackets.[^7]

    Quasi-quotations is a big second part to meta-programming. They're essentially what makes it possible to write DSLs. I'm not going to cover it here since this guide is pretty long as it is, but if you're interested, there are many guides to using quasi-quotations, find them [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~mainland/publications/mainland07quasiquoting.pdf), [here](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#th-quasiquotation), and [here](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/marcin/quasiquotation-101) (this one assumes you're familiar with Parsec parsing).


An important restriction on Template Haskell to remember is _when inside a
splice you can only call functions defined in imported modules, not functions
defined elsewhere in the same module._ Quotations and splice have to be defined
in separate modules, otherwise you'll see this error:

```
GHC stage restriction:
  `...' is used in a top-level splice or annotation,
  and must be imported, not defined locally
```

Though, if you're just binding variables in GHCi with `let`, you don't have to
worry about this -- only when you're compiling Haskell.

#### Debugging and Reification

You're probably wondering if you can evaluate a Q expression the other way, to
see what the splice is evaluating. Of course you can -- run `runQ(Q exp) >>=
putStrLn.pprint` to see what an expression with a `Q Exp` type will evaluate to:

```
> let myExp :: Q Exp; myExp = runQ [| 1 + 2 |]
> runQ(myExp) >>= putStrLn.pprint
1 GHC.Num.+ 2
```

If you want to see the expansion of splices, use the flag `-ddump-splices` when
starting GHCi : `ghci -XTemplateHaskell -ddump-splices`.

Now let's test it on another fun example with primes:[^3]

```haskell
let isPrime :: (Integral a) => a -> Bool
    isPrime k | k <=1 = False | otherwise = not $ elem 0 (map (mod k)[2..k-1])

let nextPrime :: (Integral a) => a -> a
    nextPrime n | isPrime n = n | otherwise = nextPrime (n+1)

-- returns a list of all primes between n and m, using the nextPrime function
let doPrime :: (Integral a) => a -> a -> [a]
    doPrime n m
        | curr > m = []
        | otherwise = curr:doPrime (curr+1) m
        where curr = nextPrime n

-- and our Q expression
let primeQ :: Int -> Int -> Q Exp
    primeQ n m = [| doPrime n m |]
```

```
> $(primeQ 0 67)
<interactive>:18:3-13: Splicing expression
    primeQ 0 67 ======> doPrime 0 67
[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67]
```

Try it on a nested expression, to really see how useful the dump-splices flag
is:

```
> $(primeQ ($(primeQ 0 23) !! 3) 167)
<interactive>:20:13-23: Splicing expression
    primeQ 0 23 ======> doPrime 0 23
<interactive>:20:3-34: Splicing expression
    primeQ ($(primeQ 0 23) !! 3) 167 ======> doPrime 7 167
[7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97,101,103,107,109,113,127,131,137,139,149,151,157,163,167]
```
`-ddump-splices` and `>>= putStrLn.pprint` should come in handy when debugging.

Now for probably, what I consider to be the hardest aspect of Template Haskell
to understand -- reification.

Reification allows one to query the state of Haskell
[`Name`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#t:Name)s
and get information about them. Specifically, reify returns a data type called
[`info`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#t:Info)
-- which returns data in a specific format on any `Name` in Haskell, where the
format and information depends on whether it's being interpreted in a type
context or an expression context.

TH introduces two new identifiers specifically for reification: Prefix `Name`s
to be evaluted in an expression context with a single quote, and prefix `Name`s
to be evaluated in a type context with a double quote. Though, `Name`s must be
interpretable within those contexts to be reified. (If you intend to use reify
on expressions, don't use quotes in the names of those expressions -- otherwise
it won't parse correctly.)

To use reify on a type, use double quotes:

```
> $(stringE . show =<< reify ''Bool)
"TyConI (DataD [] GHC.Types.Bool [] [NormalC GHC.Types.False [],NormalC GHC.Types.True []] [])"
```

Reifying a type returns the AST as represented by TH, here's the AST in a diagram of the boolean type from above:

![abstract syntax tree boolean](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanwestfall/templatehaskell/master/syntax_tree_bool.png)

The AST of a simple primitive type like Bool produces a small tree, but when
used on types deeper down the module chain, relatively large ASTs will be
generated. Try reify on `''Lit` or `''Exp` to know what I mean, though reify can
work on any Haskell type.

To reify an expression, use single quotes, here's an example with our `primeQ`
expression from above:

```
> $(stringE . show =<< reify 'primeQ)
"VarI primeQ_1627395913 (AppT (AppT ArrowT (ConT GHC.Types.Int)) (AppT (AppT ArrowT (ConT GHC.Types.Int)) (AppT (ConT Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Q) (ConT Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Exp)))) Nothing (Fixity 9 InfixL)"
```

As you can see `info` returns different information depending on whether it's a
type or an expression. A type returns its structure in TH's AST semantics. An
expression returns information regarding its name, type, it's constructor, and
it's fixity.

Use reification of expressions to extract the types associated with the
construction of an expression, then reify those types to get its structure in an
AST. This allows one to generate the AST of any data type in Haskell -- no
matter how deep into Haskell it gets.

Reification is very useful from the standpoint of what one can do with an AST to
draw and splice back in code fragments within a programming language. Below, in
Examples, the second example shows how one can use reify to extract the types
from a record's constructor to write a generic Show function that can generate a
`Show` for any record.

#### Examples

A good example to show what one can do with Template Haskell is a type safe
Haskell version of c's printf function (from
[stdio.h](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Formatted-Output-Functions.html)):[^5]

*Main.hs*
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

-- Import our template "printf"
import PrintF (printf)

-- The splice operator $ takes the Haskell source code
-- generated at compile time by "printf" and splices it into
-- the argument of "putStrLn".
main = do
    putStrLn $ $(printf "Hello %s %%x%% %d %%x%%") "World" 12
    putStrLn $ $(printf "Hello %s %s %s %d") "Russian" "with" "Love" 5000
```

*PrintF.hs*
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
module PrintF where

-- NB: printf needs to be in a separate module to the one where
-- you intend to use it.

-- Import some Template Haskell syntax
import Language.Haskell.TH

-- Possible string tokens: %d %s and literal strings
data Format = D | S | L String
    deriving Show

-- a poor man's tokenizer
tokenize :: String -> [Format]
tokenize [] = []
tokenize ('%':c:rest) | c == 'd' = D : tokenize rest
                      | c == 's' = S : tokenize rest
tokenize (s:str) = L (s:p) : tokenize rest -- so we don't get stuck on weird '%'
    where (p,rest) = span (/= '%') str

-- generate argument list for the function
args :: [Format] -> [PatQ]
args fmt = concatMap (\(f,n) -> case f of
                                  L _ -> []
                                  _   -> [varP n]) $ zip fmt names
    where names = [ mkName $ 'x' : show i | i <- [0..] ]

-- generate body of the function
body :: [Format] -> ExpQ
body fmt = foldr (\ e e' -> infixApp e [| (++) |] e') (last exps) (init exps)
    where exps = [ case f of
                    L s -> stringE s
                    D   -> appE [| show |] (varE n)
                    S   -> varE n
                 | (f,n) <- zip fmt names ]
          names = [ mkName $ 'x' : show i | i <- [0..] ]

-- glue the argument list and body together into a lambda
-- this is what gets spliced into the haskell code at the call
-- site of "printf"
printf :: String -> Q Exp
printf format = lamE (args fmt) (body fmt)
    where fmt = tokenize format
```

Notice that we had to separate the splicing and the expression definitions in
separate modules, as mentioned in the syntax section above.

Compile the following with:

```
$ ghc --make Main.hs -o main
```

running main will print out:

```
$ ./main
Hello World %%x%% 22 %%x%%
Hello Russian with Love 5000
```

Now for an example that shows what one can do with reify -- a Generic Show that
can produce a `Show` for any record type:[^6]

*Main.hs*
```haskell
{- Main.hs -}
module Main where
import Derive

data T = A Int String | B Integer | C
$(deriveShow ''T)

main = print [A 1 "s", B 2, C]  -- prints exactly <<[A 1 "s",B 2,C]>>
```

*Derive.hs*
```haskell
{- Derive.hs -}
module Derive where

import Language.Haskell.TH
import Control.Monad

data T1 = T1
data T2 a = T2 a

deriveShow t = do
  -- Get list of constructors for type t
  TyConI (DataD _ _ _ constructors _)  <-  reify t

  -- Make `show` clause for one constructor:
  --   show (A x1 x2) = "A "++show x1++" "++show x2
  let showClause (NormalC name fields) = do
        -- Name of constructor, i.e. "A". Will become string literal in generated code
        let constructorName = nameBase name
        -- Get variables for left and right side of function definition
        (pats,vars) <- genPE (length fields)
        -- Recursively build (" "++show x1++...++"") expression from [x1...] variables list
        let f []       = [| "" |]
            f (v:vars) = [| " " ++ show $v ++ $(f vars) |]
        -- Generate function clause for one constructor
        clause [conP name pats]                                 -- (A x1 x2)
               (normalB [| constructorName ++ $(f vars) |]) []  -- "A "++show x1++" "++show x2

  -- Make body for function `show`:
  --   show (A x1 x2) = "A "++show x1++" "++show x2
  --   show (B x1)    = "B "++show x1
  --   show C         = "C"
  showbody <- mapM showClause constructors

  -- Generate template instance declaration and then replace
  --   type name (T1) and function body (\x -> "text") with our data
  d <- [d| instance Show T1 where
             show x = "text"
       |]
  let    [InstanceD [] (AppT showt (ConT _T1)) [FunD showf _text]] = d
  return [InstanceD [] (AppT showt (ConT t  )) [FunD showf showbody]]


-- Generate n unique variables and return them in form of patterns and expressions
genPE n = do
  ids <- replicateM n (newName "x")
  return (map varP ids, map varE ids)
```

Compile the following with:

```
$ ghc --make Main.hs -o main
```

running main will print out:

```
$ ./main
[A 1 "s",B 2,C]
```

#### Conclusion

This guide was for the most part written from collecting information written in
other guides on Template Haskell, quasi-quoting, and Lisp macros -- from online,
wiki, and academic sources. Please check my bibliography to see where what came
from what so credit can be properly given where it's due.

Meta-programming is a powerful programming technique that can allow for the
generation of user generated syntax extensions and DSLs. This is useful in that
it can allow a programmer to generate custom code generating syntax extensions
without otherwise having to change the core language. Template Haskell in
particular is especially powerful over similar programming language constructs
(i.e. The C Preprocessor, Lisp's Macro system) in that it makes use of ASTs,
reification (through a specific function), and -- much in the spirit of Haskell
-- type-safety. The examples presented above only scratch the surface of what's
possible with reification -- imagine the ability to construction entire systems,
and then use reify to build ASTs, then swap in and out entire modules, entirely
with the use of Template Haskell.

Some questions that have arisen within me from writing this article are: What
are the limits of TH's data type system? Is it truly possible for TH to
represent all of Haskell with the finite set of data types written into the
module? Is it possible for future language features to defy this set? What are
the limits of meta-programming -- TH, macros, and similar meta-prorgramming
constructs make it possible to write code that writes code -- but are there
limits to this -- is it possible to write a macro that can generate a macro, and
so on indefinitely?

Don't forget to checkout the API. Everything you need to know, you can for the
most part find in the
[source](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell-2.9.0.0/docs/Language-Haskell-TH-Syntax.html#t:Lit).
Also TH does in fact have bugs, check the issue tracking page if you're dealing
with a known issue: see
[here](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&component=Template+Haskell&order=priority).
